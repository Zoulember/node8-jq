# node8-jq
I created this image to be used when I build my Node projects in BitBucket's Pipelines feature. There is currently no way to only build commits for feature branches when there's an open PR linked to it. This image is intended to be used with this fix: https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/13438#comment-40276332
